# Weekly Progress Meeting Minutes

**Date:** 2025-02-27

## 1. Summary of Weekly Progress  

- **Main Objectives:** Merge Naive Bayes files and start reading about TANs and NBs
- **Key Accomplishments:**
  - Merge CategoricalNB and GaussianNB into one file, one individual class for each one
  - Reorganized NAM code adapting it to InterpretML structure.
  - Read about TANs and BNs
  - Try some python libraries with TAN and NB
  - Continued TFG Memory
- **Overall Status:** On Track  

## 2. Task Summary  

| Task                                   | Status     | Time Spent | Summary                                                                                  |  
|----------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Merge both NBs into one file | Completed | 1.5h | Both inherit from BaseNaiveBayes class and had different methods |  
| Reorganized NAMs code | Completed | 2h | Finally made the wrapper similar to the rest of models in the library |  
| Read about TANs and BNs | Completed | 1.5h | Explore some articles and papers about it |  
| Explore and try python libraries that support TAN and NB | Completed | 1.5h | There exist different libraries but there's not an standard (as sklearn) |  
| Continued "Memoria TFG" | In progress | 1h | Read and wrote about Naive Bayes, TANs and BNs |  

## 3. Challenges/Issues  

- **Issue 1**: **Handling Different Feature Types in Naive Bayes Models**  
  - **Impact**: The base models I used as a base for Naive Bayes supported both continuous and categorical features. However, adapting them to work with InterpretML required modifying some of its built-in attributes and functions, which caused difficulties.   
  - **Proposed Solution**: Customize each Naive Bayes model to properly handle the type.

- **Issue 2**: **Limited Attributes and Methods in the Original NAM Wrapper**  
  - **Impact**:  The NAM model is well-designed, but its original wrapper lacks many attributes and methods necessary for a smooth adaptation to InterpretML. This required removing and adding several elements to make it compatible. 
  - **Proposed Solution**: Expand and refine the wrapper to improve its integration with InterpretML.  

- **Issue 3**: **Lack of a Standard Library for TANs and Bayesian Networks in Python**
  - **Impact**: There is no widely accepted standard library for Tree-Augmented Naive Bayes (TANs) and Bayesian Networks in Python. Several libraries, such as pgmpy, have been tested, but none provided a seamless implementation for this project.
  - **Proposed Solution**: Explore different libraries and consider implementing custom solutions to ensure compatibility with InterpretML.

|----------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Global Contributions NAM  | Completed | 1.5h | Using the "plot" function as a base, it wasn't difficult to recreate it with InterpretML visuals. |  
| Reorganized lots of NAM attributes and methods | Completed | 2h | As NAM wrapper was made by an independent guy, there were some difficulties integrating its code. |  
| Local Contributions NAM | Completed | 1.5h | Used global functions to obtain each local value and plot it using InterpretML visuals. |  
| Global Contributions GaussianNB | Completed | 1h | Made an initial version of the GaussianNB features global contributions. |  
| Global Contributions CategoricalNB | Completed | 2.5h | Not many problems with the calculus but the visualization, as the model was considering coded categorical features as numerical. |  
| Continued "Memoria TFG" | In progress | 1h | Read and wrote about Linear, GLM and GAM models. |  

## 3. Challenges/Issues  

- **Issue 1**: **Handling Different Feature Types in Naive Bayes Models**

# Weekly Progress Meeting Minutes

## 1. Summary of Weekly Progress  

- **Main Objectives:** Integrate local explanation of Gaussian Naive Bayes with custom visualization functions of InterpretML. 
- **Key Accomplishments:**  
  - Implemented local contributions for Naive Bayes and tested its behavior.  
  - Explored and tested LDA and QDA models, analyzing their internal attributes and decision functions.  
  - Discovered that Gaussian Naive Bayes does not natively handle missing data, despite NB should ignore it.
  - Investigated how libraries in PyPI are structured and published.  
- **Overall Status:** On Track  

## 2. Task Summary  

| Task                                   | Status     | Time Spent | Summary                                                                                  |  
|----------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Understand local contributions for Naive Bayes | Completed | 2h | Researched how to compute local contributions and implemented a version. |  
| Explore and test LDA and QDA models | Completed | 2h | Read documentation, examined the decision functions and attributes of LDA and QDA in a notebook. |  
| Investigate missing data handling in GaussianNB | Completed | 1h | Verified that GaussianNB does not support missing data directly and considered alternatives. |  
| Modify InterpretML for visualization | Completed | 2.5h | Adapted custom visualization functions for local contributions and tested them. |  
| Study PyPI repository structure | Completed | 1h | Investigated packaging and publishing workflows for Python libraries. |  
| Implement `_naivebayes.py` module | In progress | 2h | Created a module for Naive Bayes and started integrating it with the visualization functions. |  

## 3. Challenges/Issues  

- **Issue 1**: **Naive Bayes integration with visualization**  
  - **Impact**: It was challenging to align the probabilistic outputs of Naive Bayes with the existing framework for visualization.  
  - **Proposed Solution**: Took _linear.py and _decisiontree.py as a base to create _naivebayes.py, allowing me to understand the organization of the code.

### 4. Feedback & Discussion Points
- [Any feedback from progress meeting]
- [Discussion points raised during the meeting]

### 5. Goals for Next Week
- **Goal 1:** Problems on missing data on Gaussian Naive Bayes of Scikit Learn

## Weekly Progress Meeting Minutes

**Date:** 2024-11-14

### 1. Summary of Weekly Progress
- **Main Objectives:** Analyze and understand the visualization functions: 'global_explain' and 'local_explain'
- **Key Accomplishments:** 
  - Mostly understood 'global_explain' and the internal variables that interfere in the calculus.
  - Controlled the 'global_explain' visualizations, so now I can manage to change the contributions. This could be effective to use the visualizations for another model.
- **Overall Status:** On Track

### 2. Task Summary
| Task | Status | Time Spent | Summary |
|------|--------|------------|---------|
| Understand 'global_explain' function | Completed | 2h | Having read the source code now I can understand which internal variables are important |
| Control global explanations | Completed | 1h | The internal variable 'term_scores' is fundamental for the visualization |
| Understand 'local_explain' function | In progress | 2h | There are some internal functions with an undefined role that I have to analyse |
| Control local explanations | Blocked | | |


### 3. Challenges/Issues
- **Issue 1:** Issues understanding how are the calculations made to create the local contributions of each instance
  - **Impact:** Need some more days to fully comprehend the functionality
