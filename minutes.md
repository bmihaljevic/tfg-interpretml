## Weekly Progress Meeting Minutes

**Date:** 2024-11-14

---

### 1. Summary of Weekly Progress
- **Main Objectives:** Analyze and understand the visualization functions: 'global_explain' and 'local_explain'
- **Key Accomplishments:** 
  - Mostly understood 'global_explain' and the internal variables that interfere in the calculus.
  - Controlled the 'global_explain' visualizations, so now I can manage to change the contributions. This could be effective to use the visualizations for another model.
- **Overall Status:** On Track

### 2. Task Summary
| Task | Status | Time Spent | Summary |
|------|--------|------------|---------|
| Understand 'global_explain' function | Completed | 2h | Having read the source code now I can understand which internal variables are important |
| Control global explanations | Completed | 1h | The internal variable 'term_scores' is fundamental for the visualization |
| Understand 'local_explain' function | In progress | 2h | There are some internal functions with an undefined role that I have to analyse |
| Control local explanations | Blocked | | |


### 3. Challenges/Issues
- **Issue 1:** Issues understanding how are the calculations made to create the local contributions of each instance
  - **Impact:** Need some more days to fully comprehend the functionality
  - **Proposed Solution:** Fork the EBM repository to control all the internal functions and see what are they doing
