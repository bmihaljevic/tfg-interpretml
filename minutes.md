## Weekly Progress Meeting Minutes

**Date:** 2024-11-21

---

### 1. Summary of Weekly Progress
- **Main Objectives:** Import 'our' interpretml library and modify it in order to control the visualizations.
- **Key Accomplishments:** 
  - Understanding of both 'explain_global' and 'explain_local'.
  - Cloned interpretml repo and was able to modify it and use the custom functions.
  - Set constant contributions in both functions and visualize them, observing how the visualizations are.
- **Overall Status:** On Track

### 2. Task Summary
| Task | Status | Time Spent | Summary |
|------|--------|------------|---------|
| Understand both visualization functions | Completed | 2h |  |
| Clone interpret repo and use it | Completed | 2.5h | Struggled a bit trying to use our interpret folder as a library |
| Modify _ebm.py | Completed | 1.5h | By modifying the code it was easier to understand what the internal variables were doing. Set constant contributions and visualized it. |
| Naive Bayes Understanding | Completed | 1h | Tried to understand how to integrate Naive Bayes with this visualization functions |
| Naive Bayes Implementation | In progress | 2h | Created _naivebayes.py and started to program it |
| Autoimmune Disease ML Challenge - Data Understanding | Completed | 2h | Visualized and understood how the data is organized |
| Autoimmune Disease ML Challenge - Features extraction notebook | Completed | 1.5h | Created an initialization notebook that gets the features of the cell |

### 3. Challenges/Issues
  **Issue 1**: Difficulty modifying and using the source code of the InterpretML library
  **Impact**: It took significant time to understand and adapt the process since it was the first time modifying a library's source code.
  **Proposed Solution**: -

### 4. Feedback & Discussion Points
