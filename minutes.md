## 1. Summary of Weekly Progress  

- **Main Objectives:** Integrate local explanation of Categorical Naive Bayes with custom visualization functions of InterpretML. 
- **Key Accomplishments:**
  - Explored conditional probabilities of Categorical Naive Bayes.  
  - Implemented local contributions for Categorical Naive Bayes and tested its behavior.  
  - Investigated about the problem of continuous features with Categorical NB.  
  - Read about NAMs.
- **Overall Status:** On Track  

## 2. Task Summary  

| Task                                   | Status     | Time Spent | Summary                                                                                  |  
|----------------------------------------|------------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  
| Understand local contributions for Categorical Naive Bayes | Completed | 1h | Researched how to compute local contributions. |  
| Implemented local explanation for Categorical Naive Bayes | In progress | 1.5h | Did a first version of local explanation. |  
| Study the problem of Categorical NB for continuous features | In progress | 1h |  |  
| Read about NAMs | Completed | 1.5h | Read documentation, examined the structure of these networks. |  

## 3. Challenges/Issues  

- **Issue 1**: **Treating continuous features with Categorical NB**  
  - **Impact**: Continuous features can lead to inaccurate probabilities and reduced model performance since Categorical NB assumes discrete inputs.
  - **Proposed Solution**: Discretize continuous features into bins.
