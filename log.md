### Summary of the Day
- Total Hours Worked: 2.5
- Main Objective: Start creating Categorical Naive Bayes file

### Tasks Completed
1. Re-read and understand how a model and its explanations are coded in a file.
2. Create the file for Categorical Naive Bayes (maybe not necessary).
3. Understand how conditional probabilities work in CategoricalNB

### In-Progress
- Gaussian Naive Bayes Global Explanation Visualization.
- Categorical Naive Bayes Global and Local Explanation Visualization.

### Next Steps for Tomorrow
- Complete Local Explanation of Categorical Naive Bayes
- Look further into NAMs.

### Issues/Blockers
- Possibility of combining Gaussian NB and Categorical NB in the same file.

## 2024-12-09 and 2024-12-10

### Summary of the Day
- Total Hours Worked: 2
- Main Objective: Read about NAMs and check how categorical features are treated by EBMs explanations. 

### Tasks Completed
1. Read this introductory paper about NAMs: https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.13912
2. Created a notebook solving a binary classification problem to see how categorical features were treated by Interpret Explanations.

### In-Progress
- Naive Bayes Implementation and Visualization for Binary Classification.
- Naive Bayes Global Explanation Visualization.
- Reading and comprehension about NAMs.

### Next Steps for Tomorrow
- Look further into NAMs.
- Check some interesting visualizations in Yellowbrick that can be useful. 

### Issues/Blockers
