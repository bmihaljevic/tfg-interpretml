### Summary of the Day
- Total Hours Worked: 3
- Main Objective: Learn how EBM visualize each feature importance (global and local) and try some YellowBrick functionalities.

### Tasks Completed
1. EBMs on binary classification problem: Use a binary classification problem to understand the interpretability of EBMs and the explanations given.

2. EBMs on multiclass classification problem: Use a multiclass classification problem to extend the knowledge of the first task.

3. YellowBrick features: Try some visualization techniques given by YellowBrick with the multiclass classification problem to see how it works. 

### In-Progress
None

### Next Steps for Tomorrow
- Task 1: Understand in depth how the EBMs visualization/explanation function works.
- Task 2: Try to modify some internal data of the model to visualize what i want. 

### Issues/Blockers
- Understanding the source code of EBMs: I tried to understand some functions as the 'explain_global' independently, but it was not easy. I'll have to take a general look at the code to understand what each internal variable of the model means.
