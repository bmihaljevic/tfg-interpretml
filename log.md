### Summary of the Day
- Total Hours Worked: 2
- Main Objective: Understanding the structure of a model file (based on _linear.py), in order to create _naivebayes.py, and start doing the model. 

### Tasks Completed
1. Understood _linear.py and internal associated functions.
2. Started programming on _naivebayes.py based on _linear.py and reached to explain_local function.
3. Understood which parameters are necessary to create conditional probabilities for NB. 

### In-Progress
- Naive Bayes Implementation and Visualization for Binary Classification.

### Next Steps for Tomorrow
- Keep going on _naivebayes.py, creating the conditional probabilities function and visualize local explanations.

### Issues/Blockers
- As I was looking at _linear.py model to create _naivebayes.py, I had no problem understanding the code (except some of the internal functions) because it's the simplest model they have.
