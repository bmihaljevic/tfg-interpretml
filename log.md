### Summary of the Day
- Total Hours Worked: 1.5
- Main Objective: Understand how the EBMs explanations graphs are made.

### Tasks Completed
1. Bins and scores: Comprehend how are they used for the visualization, specifically in 'explain_global'.

2. Modify scores: Change the scores of a variable to be able to "control" what is being visualized. I visualized random and constant scores.  

### In-Progress
None

### Next Steps for Tomorrow
- Task 1: Analyze the 'explain_global' function. Study this function in detail to understand how it creates explanations and how it uses internal variables.
- Task 2: Take a look at the 'explain_local' function.
- 

### Issues/Blockers
- Understanding EBM variables in visualizations: Some internal variables are still unclear regarding their role in the model explanations.
