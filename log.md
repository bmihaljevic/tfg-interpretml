### Summary of the Day
- Total Hours Worked: 2
- Main Objective: Understand and investigate about the three topics mentioned in the meeting.

### Tasks Completed
1. Proved that GaussianNB from sklearn can't handle missing data.
2. Understood that Naive Bayes should handle missing data without problem, because it can be ignored.
3. Investigate about the uploading of a package to the PyPi repository. 
4. Started reading about Discriminant Analysis.

### In-Progress
- Naive Bayes Implementation and Visualization for Binary Classification.
- Naive Bayes Global Explanation visualization.
- Comprehension of Discriminant Analysis.

### Next Steps for Tomorrow
- Look further into Discriminant Analysis.
- Create a notebook using DA using and understanding its internal parameters.

### Issues/Blockers
