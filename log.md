### Summary of the Day
- Total Hours Worked: 2
- Main Objective: Modify source code of 'EBMs' and control de visualizations. 

### Tasks Completed
1. Understanding of global and local explain function.
1. Modify feature contributions (both in global and local explain function), so now it shows constant weights for each feature. This will allow us to use this graphical tools to visualize Naive Bayes contributions.

### In-Progress
- Naive Bayes feature contribution visualization.

### Next Steps for Tomorrow
- Task 1: Naive Bayes understanding and thinking how to integrate it.

### Issues/Blockers
- No big problems today. With the control of the library, if I have an issue I can execute a print and see what is happening.
