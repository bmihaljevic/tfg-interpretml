## 2024-11-19


### Summary of the Day
- Total Hours Worked: 2
- Main Objective: Modify source code of 'EBMs' and control de visualizations. 

### Tasks Completed
1. Understanding of global and local explain function.
1. Modify feature contributions (both in global and local explain function), so now it shows constant weights for each feature. This will allow us to use this graphical tools to visualize Naive Bayes contributions.

### In-Progress

## 2024-11-18


### Summary of the Day
- Total Hours Worked: 2.5
- Main Objective: Use our 'interpretml' version. 

### Tasks Completed
1. Modify some part of the source code of the EBMs and verify that 'our' version of the library is working. In order to do that, I uninstalled the original interpretml library and installed it again (both interpret and interpret-core) pointing to our 'interpret' folder. I executed it in editable mode (pip install -e ...) so now every change in the source code will be instantly applied to the library.

### In-Progress
Understanding of 'explain_global' function.
Modify the code of 'global_explain' and 'local_explain' and try other importances. This will allow us to visualize other models. 

### Next Steps for Tomorrow
- Task 1: Modify the code of 'global_explain' and 'local_explain' and try other importances.

### Issues/Blockers
- Still some problems with the library, specifically with 'libebm'. 'libebm' is a shared library that the EBM model needs, but it isn't in the github interpret repository, I think. I had to add a \root folder (which I found in the original interpret package folder in my PC) in the interpret-core folder. Now it is solved.

## 2024-11-15


### Summary of the Day
- Total Hours Worked: 1.5

### In-Progress
Understanding of 'local_explain' function.
Import "our" interpretml-custom library and use this one instead of the original.

### Next Steps for Tomorrow
- Task 1: Import "our" library and ensure it is working correctly. 

### Issues/Blockers
- Problems/Confusions related to libraries, versions and names. When trying to use "our" library, I struggled trying to import it and use it. However, I don't think this will be a problem. I will inspect what is happening and how to fix it.

## 2024-11-14


### Summary of the Day
- Total Hours Worked: 1.5
- Main Objective: Understand how the EBMs local explanations graphs are made.

### Next Steps for Tomorrow

### Issues/Blockers
- There are some internal EBM functions with no comments so I don't really understand their goal.
