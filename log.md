### Summary of the Day
- Total Hours Worked: 1.5
- Main Objective: Understand how the EBMs local explanations graphs are made.

### Tasks Completed
1. 'local explain' function read: I tried to understand how the visualization was made by reading the code.

2. Partial understanding of 'local explain': I mostly understood how the function works but still need to clarify some aspects.

### In-Progress
Understanding of 'local_explain' function.

### Next Steps for Tomorrow
- Task 1: Analyze the 'explain_local' function to finally understand it.

### Issues/Blockers
- There are some internal EBM functions with no comments so I don't really understand their goal.
