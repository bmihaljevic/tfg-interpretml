### Summary of the Day
- Total Hours Worked: 1.5
- Main Objective: 'interpretml' clone to work with it locally. 

### Tasks Completed
1. The library was succesfully cloned in the repository.

### In-Progress
Understanding of 'local_explain' function.
Import "our" interpretml-custom library and use this one instead of the original.

### Next Steps for Tomorrow
- Task 1: Import "our" library and ensure it is working correctly. 

### Issues/Blockers
- Problems/Confusions related to libraries, versions and names. When trying to use "our" library, I struggled trying to import it and use it. However, I don't think this will be a problem. I will inspect what is happening and how to fix it.
